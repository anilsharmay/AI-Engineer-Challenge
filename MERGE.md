# PDF Upload and RAG System - Merge Instructions

## Overview
This feature adds comprehensive PDF upload functionality and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to the MS DOS Chatbot. Users can now upload PDF documents, process them for indexing, and chat with the content using AI-powered retrieval.

## Changes Summary

### Backend Enhancements
- **New Dependencies**: Added PyPDF2 and numpy for PDF processing
- **PDF Upload Endpoint**: `/api/upload-pdf` with file validation and size limits
- **PDF Processing Pipeline**: `/api/process-pdf/{filename}` using aimakerspace library
- **RAG Chat Endpoint**: `/api/rag-chat` for document-based conversations
- **Document Management**: List, status, and delete endpoints
- **Vector Database**: Persistent storage of document embeddings
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback

### Frontend Enhancements
- **PDF Upload Interface**: DOS-styled file upload with progress indicators
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between General and RAG chat modes
- **Document Status Panel**: Real-time document processing status
- **Document Selector**: Choose documents for RAG chat
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: F1 (Upload), F2 (Documents), Ctrl+C (Clear)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Enhanced UI**: Maintains consistent DOS aesthetic

### Technical Features
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time chat responses for both modes
- **File Validation**: PDF-only uploads with 10MB size limit
- **Context Retrieval**: AI answers using only document content
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time processing and indexing status
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of upload and processing errors

- [ ] Test with various PDF file sizes and types

### 3. User Testing
- [ ] Test complete upload workflow
- [ ] Verify document processing and indexing
- [ ] Test RAG chat functionality
- [ ] Validate error scenarios

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with new features
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add user guide for PDF upload and RAG chat

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise after merge:
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert <merge-commit-hash>

# Or reset to previous state
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
